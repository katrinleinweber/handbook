### Fieldbook Guide

The Carpentries uses [Fieldbook](http://www.fieldbook.com) to manage membership information.
Fieldbook tracks things such as

* Lead - Interest in membership has been expressed, but an agreement may or may not be likely 
* Stale - At one point was pending or lead, but a membership does now not seem likely
