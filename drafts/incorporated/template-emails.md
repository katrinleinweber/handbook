Deadline approaching to certify as a Software and Data Carpentry Instructor

Hi everyone,

You’re receiving this email because you recently attended a training event to become a Software and Data Carpentry instructor, but haven’t yet completed the follow-up tasks to become certified. We generally require new instructors to complete certification within three months of their training, to ensure that they are up to date on our teaching methods and practices. If you are still planning on certifying and would like an extension on your deadline, please send an email to checkout@carpentries.org. If you believe you’re receiving this email in error and have already completed the checkout process, please get in touch as we may have missed recording one of your checkout steps.

If you have any questions about the checkout process, please take a look at our checklist: http://www.datacarpentry.org/checkout/ and feel free to send any questions to checkout@carpentries.org.

Looking forward to having you as part of our Instructor community!

Best wishes,
Erin Becker

Applicant selected for open online instructor training event (this has been migrated to a script)

Hi [name],

Thank you for applying to become an instructor with Software and Data Carpentry. We received many more applications than we expected and it has taken us some time to review applications. Thank you for your patience!

We are excited about your application and are looking forward to having you as a member of our instructor community. We’d like to invite you to participate in an instructor training event July 10th and 11th. This event will be held online over video conference 9 am - 5 pm in Central European time (7 am - 3 pm UTC). Please click this link for your local start time: link. Because the group will be meeting by video conference, you will need a consistent and strong internet connection throughout the two-day event. All training participants do need to attend the entirety of the training event in order to become certified Software and Data Carpentry instructors. If you have any conflicts with this time, please let us know and we will try to find you a seat at a later training event.

Please respond by Friday, June 23rd to let us know whether or not you will be able to attend. If we haven’t heard from you by that time, we will offer the seat to another applicant, however, you will still remain at the top of the applicant list and we will happily try to accommodate you at a later training.

If you have any questions about the training, please let me know. We’re looking forward to having you as a Carpentry instructor!

Best,
Erin Becker
