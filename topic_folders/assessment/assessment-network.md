### Assessment Network

#### About
The Assessment Network was established in October 2016 as a space for those working on assessment within the open source/research computing space to collaborate and share resources.

#### What We Do
The Assessment Network meets quarterly to discuss best-practices and projects around assessing outcomes in scientific computing. For past meeting information, check out the [minutes](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment/tree/master/assessment-network/minutes) in the Assessment Network [repo](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment/tree/master/assessment-network).
