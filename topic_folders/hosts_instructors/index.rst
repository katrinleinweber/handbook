TEACHING AND HOSTING
=======================

Opportunities for certified instructors to teach Carpentries workshops are listed `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gYmN7zn1dcrQTFGunsCq6Pqj82Hs2csoCL9hjt0o3uo/edit#gid=0>`_.  Join the `instructors mailing list <http://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors>`_ to be notified when new opportunities are posted.

For centrally organized workshops, the Workshop Administrator will guide the host and instructor on following through on all these steps.

Certified instructors are also encouraged to run self organized workshops.  For self organized workshops, the host and instructor are directly responsible for ensuring all the steps below are followed without support from the Workshop Administrator.
