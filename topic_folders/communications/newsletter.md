#### Publishing the newsletter

This information is intended for staff or community members who have taken on the responsibility of publishing the newsletter.

Each newsletter is a campaign on MailChimp.

To create a new newsletter, log in to MailChimp and click on *Campaigns*.  Make a copy of the latest newsletter and rename the copy to reflect the current date (e.g. `Carpentry Clippings, 27 March, 2018.`).

Check the *To* field is correctly set as going to *x* number of newsletter subscribers.

Check the *From* field is correctly set as coming from *The Carpentries*.

Select *Edit design* to add newsletter content. When the newsletter opens, click the pencil icon in the newsletter on the left to open the newsletter for editing. (Editing is all done within the right pane; the left pane renders the public view as you edit.)

Remove old content and paste in the new.

Highlight each paragraph and click *Clear styles* if anything you are copying in appears in bold when you don't want it to.

Add images by clicking on the *Image* icon in the edit window.  All images must be no more than 550px wide to render properly. These can be resized within MailChimp by working with the image styling and location.

Go to *Preview and Test* to preview the newsletter before sending it out. This includes a desktop and mobile version preview.  Send a test email to yourself to preview it in your email client.

*Save and Close* and schedule the newsletter to be sent.  This should always be set for Tuesday at 9 am Eastern time.  A confirmation message saying "Rock On! Your campaign has been scheduled" will be displayed.

The newsletter will now be locked.  If any changes need to be made after it has been scheduled, you will need to pause the campaign, make changes, and restart the campaign. 

After a campaign has been paused and then restarted, it is important to doublecheck that the date and time for sending out the newsletter is correctly set as this will often default to the current time, rather than the original scheduled time.

The previous newsletter is then moved into the **Carpentry Clippings** folder which adds it to the searchable online archive. To move it, check the box next to the newsletter and select the correct folder when the `Move to` option appears.
