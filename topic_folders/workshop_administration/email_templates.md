Subject: About hosting a Carpentries Workshop

Dear [ name ],

Thanks so much for inquiring about hosting a Carpentries workshop at [ site_name ].  Here's some background about our programs and how we run.

Software Carpentry (SWC) and Data Carpentry (DC) are two programs of The Carpentries (a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives). Both programs offer two day long workshops taught live in-person by a team of two trained instructors. Software Carpentry focuses on best practices in computational programming that help scientists and researchers be more effective with their work. Lessons are domain agnostic and use generic data. All Software Carpentry workshops always cover three core areas: shell scripting (bash), version control (Git), and a programming language (R or Python). Read more here (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/). Data Carpentry has a similar foundation but focuses on the data lifecycle, from cleaning & organization to analysis & visualization. Lessons and the data they use are domain specific, with offerings in ecology/biology, genomics, geospatial data, and more in the works. Read more here (http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/ ).

All workshops have a standard fee of US$2500, plus any costs for instructor travel (which may include airfare, ground travel, hotel, and meals/incidentals).
You can read more about the costs and how to request a workshop here for Software Carpentry (https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/request/) and here for Data Carpentry (http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops-host/).

Workshops are offered on demand, not on a set schedule, and typically require 2-3 months lead time to plan.

I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about holding a Carpentries workshop at [ site_name ] by email, or set some time to talk by phone or videocall. Let me know what you're thinking of doing, and we'll talk about how we can work together.  I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best,

[ your_name ]


##### Confirming instructor availability

Hi [ instructor name ],

You signed up as interested in teaching the [ Carpentry type ] workshop at [ site name ] on [ scheduled dates ].  I'm writing to see if you are still interested and available in doing this, and what questions you may have about it. If this works, I'll send an email to you and the hosts at [ site name ] so we can get started planning. 

*If flexible dates* Could you also let me know if you have any preferences or constraints in the date range we're looking at?

Thanks so much for considering this - I'm hoping it works out for you. Can you let me know by [ date ]?  I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,

##### Host and instructor introductions

Subject: Carpentries workshop at [ site_name ], [ Date of Workshop ] - Making introductions

Hi everyone,

This email is to introduce [ host_name ] of [ site_name ] with instructors [ instructor1_name ] and [ instructor2_name ]. They will be teaching a [ carpentry_type ] workshop on [ workshop_date ].

I also want to introduce our Workshop Administrator, [ admin_name ]. [ She or he ] will be supporting all of the logistical details with this workshop.

Next steps:

Instructors will work directly with [ host_first_name ] to make travel arrangements. We are not part of this process. This may include airfare, ground travel, hotel, and meals/incidentals. [ host_first_name ], it is up to you whether you want to book things directly or have instructors make their own arrangements and get reimbursed. Either way, please keep in mind our instructors are volunteering two days of their time to teach with you, so please support them in making travel and reimbursement as smooth as possible.

You can all read more about the roles of workshop hosts, instructors, and helpers here (http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html). I'll highlight a few things here.

[ host_first_name ] , can you share a little about who your learners are and what you and they are expecting? That will help our instructors be prepared. We also like to have a couple of helpers at each workshop from the local community. Would you be able to help secure a couple of helpers? They don't need to be connected with us; they just need a good understanding of the technologies we teach and an enthusiasm to help others.

[ instructor1_first_name ] and [ instructor2_first_name ], please feel free to introduce yourselves and share a bit about your backgrounds. We value the background and expertise you bring to this, and want to hear about you.

[ instructor1_first_name ] and [ instructor2_first_name ] will divide up the curriculum:

https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/

OR

http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/

to know who's teaching what. One of them will create the workshop's web page on GitHub, which will include workshop details and instructions on what learners will need to install on their computers. The template can be found here:

https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template

Please use the workshop id [ workshop_id in form of YYYY-MM-DD-sitename ]

[ host_first_name ], if you want to handle registration internally that's fine. Otherwise [ admin_name ] can work with you to create an Eventbrite registration page. She will need to know a total count, the registration fee (if any, as well as a refund policy), and the exact location. Regardless, all learners should complete pre/post workshop surveys which will be available on the webpage the instructors create.  [ admin_name ] will share links so you all can view survey results.

[ admin_name ] will check in over the next few weeks and after it's all over to hear how it went -- including getting attendance figures, ideally broken out by number registered and number attended each day. Any of you are also welcome to join our instructor discussion sessions before and/or after the workshop. It's a great way to ask questions and share ideas with other instructors before you teach, and to give us feedback after you teach. Check out the schedule and sign up here: http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion

We are so glad to have everyone confirmed for this. Please email any questions you all may have for us or each other.  

Thanks so much! 

Best,

#### From Instructors and Hosts

##### For Self Organized Workshops: Recruiting Co-instructor

Subject: Recruiting co-instructors for Carpentry Workshop

Hi [ person name ], 

I'm organizing a local [ Data/Library/Software ] Carpentry workshop for [ estimated month/season of workshop ].  The Carpentries are a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initaitives. They teach skills that are immediately useful for researchers, using lessons and datasets that allow researchers to quickly apply what they've learned to their own work. I'm really excited about using the [ Data/Library/Software ] Carpentry curriculum here to help our [graduate students/staff/faculty - your target audience] become more efficient in their research.

I've completed instructor training for The Carpentries and am certified to teach their materials. To run a workshop, I'll need at least one (preferably two) co-instructors to help out in teaching the material. The workshops are two days long and instructors usually switch every half day. I'm planning to cover [ your workshop topics ] and was hoping you could teach the [ topic ] section of the workshop. The Carpentries provides ready-to-go lesson materials, so we wouldn't need to develop anything from scratch. If you're interested, you can see the materials for [ topic ] here [ link to lesson ] and the rest of the curricular materials here [link to http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/ or https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ ].

I'm looking forward to running a workshop here and think it will be very helpful to our [ target audience ]. If you're interested in being a co- instructor, please let me know and we can get together and plan. Also let me know if you know anyone else who might be interested and able to help out with the [ topic ] part of the workshop.

Looking forward to working with you on this!

Best,

##### Recruiting Helpers

Subject: Recruiting helpers for Carpentry Workshop

Hi [ name ], 

I'm running a [ Data/Library/Software ] Carpentry workshop on [ dates of workshop ]. The Carpentries are a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initaitives. They teach skills that are immediately useful for researchers, using lessons and datasets that allow researchers to quickly apply what they've learned to their own work. I'm really excited about using the [ Data/Library/Software ] Carpentry curriculum here to help our [graduate students/staff/faculty - your target audience] become more efficient in their research.

During the workshop, I'll need a few people to help out in case learners run into problems or get stuck. Helpers move around the room to answer questions and help learners work through things like installation problems, error messages and unexpected output. You don't need to be an expert in the tools we're covering, just to have used one or more of them and be comfortable helping people troubleshoot. At this workshop, we're planning on covering [ list of your topics ]. I think you would be a great person to help out with [ topic ]. If you're interested, you can see the materials for [ topic]  here [link to lesson] and the rest of the curricular materials here [link to http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/ or https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ ].  Please let me know if you're interested in being a helper and if you know anyone else who might be willing to help out.

Best,
