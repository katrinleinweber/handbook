The Carpentries are preparing to publish {{ lesson list }} on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) in {{ month(s) }}. This will be the first publication for our new {{ new lesson list }} lessons. We regularly [publish our lessons](https://zenodo.org/communities/swcarpentry/) to provide stable identifiers for polished versions of the lessons. This enables referenced discussions of the lesson materials and gives contributors a verifiable product to cite on their CVs or resumes.  

This release will include the following lessons:  {{ bulleted list of lessons, for Data Carpentry lessons, link to the workshop home page instead of individual repos }}.
