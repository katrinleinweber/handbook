## Lesson Development Roles

### Curriculum Advisory Committee

Curriculum Advisors are part of a team that provides the oversight, vision, and leadership for a particular set of lessons. Advisors represent The Carpentries community and should strive to embody The Carpentries philosophy by:
- Recognizing the importance of communication and being welcoming to all contributors.
- Giving feedback to contributors using The Carpentries model:
  - Find what’s good. Be specific about improvements needed. Use motivational language.
  - Evaluating lesson contributions in light of The Carpentries pedagogical model:
  - Teach what’s most relevant and useful for learners.
  - Avoid getting bogged down in technical details.
  - Keep language motivating. 
  - Emphasize the importance of continued learning and improvement.

Curriculum Advisors are responsible for: 

- Routinely, as needed:
  - Responding to requests for comments on curriculum in GitHub.
  - Acting as Maintainers for the workshop homepage repository for their curriculum - making sure it’s up to date with the overall 
  goals of the workshops, correcting links to curriculum, and updating as needed.

- Meet bi-annually to:
  - Discuss curricular updates that have been proposed by Instructors, Maintainers, or other community members.
  - Provide recommendations for other potential updates based on current approaches in the field.
  - Discuss proposals for new lesson ideas and provide recommendations about whether they should be developed or accepted and whether they should be incorporated into existing workshop curriculum or standalone.
  - Provide a written report of the meeting regarding decisions around curriculum updates and recommendations.
  - Review individual lessons to make sure curriculum-level learning objectives are being met by the set of lessons.
  - Prepare the workshop homepage repository for lesson release. Curriculum Advisors will be listed as Editors for this repository at release.

Curriculum Advisors commit to serving a one year term, but are welcome to continue for additional years.
