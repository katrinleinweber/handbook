##### New member site welcome

Subject: Carpentries instructor training for [ site_name ]

Hi [ site contact name ],

I'm reviewing all our new Carpentries memberships and I see that [ site_name ] is about to join us as a member site. So I wanted to check in with you about online instructor training for your team -- one of the benefits offered to you as part of the membership package.

We have a calendar ready for online training events in [ date_range ].  

You can read more about the whole process here:  http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/partners/

and check out our training calendar here:  https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar/

If you're interested in joining one of these events, please email me back to let me know.  Note that each event closes one month before the event.  If you'd prefer to wait until [ next_time_frame ] for this training, I'll have a [ next_time_frame ] calendar ready in [ month ].  In any case, you'll have [ number ]  slots available, and ideally they must all attend the same event together -- we want to build a cohort at your site. If this proves to be prohibitive please let me know so we can discuss other options.

I'm excited to see you build a team of Carpentries instructors at [ site_name ] which will put you on track to running Carpentries workshops with onsite instructors. Let me know if you have questions about how all this works.  I'd be happy to answer any questions by email or set some time to talk by phone. Thanks -  I'm looking forward to get your team on board!

Best,

##### Member training introductions

Subject: Carpentries Instructor Training Introductions

Hello everyone,

Thank you for joining our upcoming instructor training session on  [ DATE-TIME-TIMEZONE ] with  [ site_names ]. As a reminder, this is a training for people who want to become instructors with Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry. The workshop is a mix of lectures and hands-on lessons where you practice giving a short lesson using approaches learned and implement some of the teaching techniques which we will discuss. This is training for teaching, not technical training; you do not need any particular technical background, and we will not be teaching that. This workshop is based on our constantly revised and updated curriculum (https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).

This will be offered online with our instructor trainers, [ trainer1 ]  and [ trainer2 ]. You can read more about what you'll do these two days here: [ webpage ]

If you haven't already, you must complete our online application form here (https://amy.software-carpentry.org/forms/request_training/) so we can officially record your participation and track your progress towards becoming a certified Carpentries instructor. Please use the group code [ group_code ] 

Participants from each site should be in the same room. Individuals can not join remotely as our training includes partner and group activities. All individual participants should have wifi access.

Please plan to be present for the entire session both days. Participants who miss more than one hour will not pass our training requirements.

A videoconferencing link will be shared with the organizers/hosts at each site before the meeting. You should be in a room with a screen and projector as well as a speaker and microphone.  This link is for the room; individual participants do not need this information. We highly encourage the host sites test this connection in advance, in the same room using the same equipment that you'll be using for the training itself. Please contact me directly if you'd like to set a time to do so. We will start promptly on time; any time lost due to troubleshooting connection problems may count against your attendance.

*Some other things in order to prepare:*

1. Please read this short paper, which provides a brief overview of some key evidence-based results in teaching: "The Science of Learning" (https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf)

2. Please go to the Software Carpentry lessons page (http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and the Data Carpentry lessons page (http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/), have a look at what we currently teach, and then choose *one* episode from the list at the bottom of this message and read through it carefully. You will be using your selected episode for several in-class exercises, so be sure you are comfortable with the content.

3. We will be recording one another teaching in pairs or threes during the class, so please bring a cell phone or hand-held camera that can record audio and video. It doesn't have to be high-quality, but it should be good enough that you can understand what someone is saying.

4. Please also bring a laptop powerful enough to teach on so that you can take part in all of the practical exercises (a tablet/Chromebook/etc. won't be sufficient). No special setup on your own laptops is necessary.

5. Please complete the pre-assessment survey, found on the website above. This survey, along with our post-assessment, provides valuable information that we use to improve our program and report on our impacts.

Please note that after this course is over, you will be asked to do three short follow-up exercises online in order to finish qualifying as an instructor: the details are available at http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/. If you have any questions about the workshop, the reading material, or anything else, please get in touch.

Please read carefully through *one* of the episodes below, so that you can do some exercises based on it on the first day of the class.

##### Zoom test invitation to host site

Hi [Host Name],

Thank you for hosting a Carpentries Instructor Training on [ date/time including time zone]. We will be using the Zoom videoconferencing platform for this event.  To ensure that the training runs smoothly, Iâ€™d like to set up a Zoom test run with you prior to the event. This should not take much time, however, it is important that this happens to detect any problems and have time to troubleshoot them prior to the training. We all want to stick to the schedule, and want to avoid spending time troubleshooting on the morning of the event.

A few things to consider when conducting the test:
* Be in the room that the training will take place in. 
* Have access to the audio system that will be used
* Have access to the projector that will be used

We will make sure that we can see and hear each other, and that I can see all the seats people will be in for the event itself.

To schedule a test run, you can [ email me/look at my calendar ]. Please let me know if you cannot find a time that works, so we can look for some other options.

I'm looking forward to having your team on board! Please let me know if you have any questions about how this works.

Best,

##### Recruiting new trainers

Subject: Opportunity to join Carpentries trainers community

Hi [ name ],

I wanted to get in touch with you about an opportunity to get involved with the Software and Data Carpentry community. Software Carpentry (SWC) and Data Carpentry (DC) are two programs of The Carpentries (a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initaitives). We are focused on spreading computational literacy to researchers around the world. We run intensive, hands-on, two-day workshops to help researchers and other professionals develop the fundamental computational skills they need to do their research. Together, we run over 300 workshops a year, and have reached more than 25,000 learners in 30 countries.

Our workshops are taught by volunteers who go through a two-day training program focused on pedagogy and cognitive psychology. These training events are run by our Instructor Trainers who also help to develop and maintain our instructor training curriculum. 

Carpentry Trainers are an eclectic group. Some of us have formal training in pedagogy, some are experienced Carpentry instructors, others run Carpentry-like trainings as part of their jobs. We all share a commitment to helping new instructors become familiar and comfortable with Carpentry teaching practices and principles.

If youâ€™re interested in joining the Trainer community, please apply here (https://goo.gl/forms/yTx9yJzdWy6OAPtS2)! Applications for this round will be open until [application_deadline]. 

If you have any questions about the training process or the expectations for being a Trainer, please contact team@carpentries.org

To learn more about what we teach, check out our lessons here: (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and here: (http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/).
More detailed information about what Trainers do can be found here: (https://github.com/carpentries/policies/blob/master/trainer-agreement.md).

Looking forward to seeing an application from you!

##### Accepting new trainers

Subject: Congratulations! Join the Carpentries Trainer Community

Hi all,

Thank you all for applying to become instructor Trainers with the Carpentries. A group of Trainers have reviewed the applications and we're excited to invite each of you to the Trainer team.

We'll be starting our new cohort of instructor Trainers in [ month ]. Our cohort will be [ number ] folks located in [ countries ]. We'll be meeting once a week starting in [ month ] to discuss our text and how it relates to our instructor training curriculum. More details can be found in the preliminary reading schedule.

If you're interested in being part of this cohort, please try to complete the following by [ deadline ] so that we can finalize the schedule and start our meetings!

1) Please fill out this poll [ link ] for scheduling book club meetings. Don't forget to adjust the timezone shown (pull down menu above the time list). Please choose the days and times that work for you for the entire 8 week period of our book club. To complete certification as a Trainer, we'll ask that you miss at most one of our 8 book club meetings. Since we are spread across several time zones, please be as accommodating as possible in filling out your availability. We will have two meeting times per week to accomodate all time zones, but you will only need to attend one of the weekly meetings.

2) Please take a look over the process for trainer training and make sure that all of the requirements of becoming a Trainer work with your schedule and other responsibilities. We're excited to have you in the Trainer community, but do want to make sure that all Trainers are able to commit the time required, so that we are able to realistically determine the number of instructors we train per year.

3) Please get a copy of our text [ link ]. I'll send out reading assignments and discussion guides in a later email. 

4) Please also fill out your availability for instructor training events for [ month through month ] and add your name to the Trainers list in the second tab. This cohort of Trainers will be ready to co-teach instructor training events by the end of [ month ] and to teach on their own shortly after that.

5) Please add upcoming Trainer Business and Discussion meetings (http://pad.software-carpentry.org/trainers) to your calendar. These are also on the Community Calendar. Each of these is held in two different time zones - you don't need to attend both meetings, but you're welcome to!

6) Please sign up for the Trainers email list (http://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/trainers) if you haven't already done so.

7) Please respond to this email with a quick introduction so that we can all get to know each other. I'll send out my introduction as a separate email following this.

I know that's a lot! Let me know if you have any questions. I'm looking forward to seeing you all at our first book club discussion.

Best,
