Looking forward to having you as a Carpentry Instructor!

##### Reminder teaching demo

Subject: Software/Data Carpentry teaching demonstration

Hi,

According to http://pad.software-carpentry.org/teaching-demos you have signed up to give an online teaching demo on [ date ] at [ time ] (See this link for your local time: [ timeanddate.com link ]). I will be the Instructor Trainer running the session.

I wanted to make it very clear that I may give you any segment of the lesson you prepared to teach, so you must be ready to teach any part of your chosen lesson. Some people prepare to teach 5 minutes from a particular section and nothing else, and these often have to reschedule as they seldom are assigned the section they have prepared for. A lesson corresponds to a single line in the lesson tables (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ and http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/) and a single repository on GitHub. Some lessons have supplementary modules, but you do not need to be prepared to teach the supplementary modules for your teaching demonstration.

For example, if you have chosen The Unix Shell, I may assign you any episode listed at http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/.

Please visit the Etherpad a little while before the demo starts, I will post a link there to another Etherpad we will be using for this demo.

See you at the demo session,
